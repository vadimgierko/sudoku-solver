- rewrite the app in TypeScript
- add About page
- generate more template sudokus
- enable displaying all steps taken to solve sudoku & controlled setInterval to show the process
- enable user control over the taken steps & choosing/ applying them
- fix board size while completing the board & after saving (it must be same size & be in same place - no bouncing)
- enable navigating using keybord while inputing numbers into the board
- develop algorithms for more advanced sudokus
- fix infinite loop while inputing numbers into the board (the bug does not crash the app, but still the loop runs while inputing, what can be seen in the console...)
- develop algorithm for generating sudoku...
